= Quarkus Azure Key Vault Extension

include::./includes/attributes.adoc[]

include::./includes/support.adoc[]

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/key-vault[Azure Key Vault] is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, or cryptographic keys. 
This extension allows you to create and retrieve secret from Azure Key Vault by injecting the following object inside your Quarkus application.

* `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretClient` 
* `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretAsyncClient` 

The extension produces SecretClient and  SecretAsyncClient using https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/overview/azure/identity-readme#defaultazurecredential[DefaultAzureCredential].
Developers who want more control or whose scenario isn't served by the default settings should build client using other credential types.

== Installation

If you want to use this extension, you need to add the `io.quarkiverse.azureservices:quarkus-azure-services` extension first to your build file.

For instance, with Maven, add the following dependency to your POM file:

[source,xml,subs=attributes+]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkiverse.azureservices</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-azure-keyvault</artifactId>
    <version>{project-version}</version>
</dependency>
----

== How to Use It

Once you have added the extension to your project, follow the next steps, so you can inject  `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretClient` or `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretAsyncClient` object in your application to manage secret.

=== Setup your Azure Environment

include::includes/azure-setup-environment.adoc[]

Create an Azure resource group with the `az group create` command.
A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

[source,shell]
----
az group create \
    --name rg-quarkus-azure-keyvault \
    --location eastus
----

Create a general-purpose key vault with the following command:

[source,shell]
----
az keyvault create --name kvquarkusazurekv0423 \
    --resource-group rg-quarkus-azure-keyvault \
    --location eastus
----

Key Vault provides secure storage of generic secrets, such as passwords and database connection strings.
All secrets in your key vault are stored encrypted. The Azure Key Vault service encrypts your secrets when you add them, and decrypts them automatically when you read them.

Access Control for secrets managed in Key Vault, is provided at the level of the Key Vault.
The following command uses your Microsoft Entra ID to authorize the operation to manage secret.
Even if you are the key vault owner, you need explicit permissions to perform operations against secret.

Assign all secret permissions(backup, delete, get, list, purge, recover, restore, set) to yourself:

[source,shell]
----
az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv \
    | az keyvault set-policy \
    --name kvquarkusazurekv0423 \
    --object-id @- \
    --secret-permissions all
----

If you log into the http://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal], you can see the key vault you created. Select **Objects** -> **Secrets**, you will find the Secrets page.

=== Configure the Azure Key Vault Secret Client

As you can see below in the _Configuration Reference_ section, the configuration option `quarkus.azure.keyvault.secret.endpoint` is mandatory.
To get the endpoint, execute the following Azure CLI command:

[source,shell]
----
az keyvault show --name kvquarkusazurekv0423 \
    --resource-group rg-quarkus-azure-keyvault \
    --query properties.vaultUri \
    --output tsv
----

Then, in the `application.properties` file, add the following property:

[source,properties]
----
quarkus.azure.keyvault.secret.endpoint=https://kvquarkusazurekv0423.vault.azure.net/
----

=== Inject the Azure Key Vault Secret Client

Now that your Azure environment is ready and that you have configured the extension, you can inject the `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretClient` object in your application, so you can interact with Azure Key Vault Secret.

This is a https://quarkus.io/guides/command-mode-reference[Quarkus CLI application]. The application will:

* Ask for a secret value.
* Create a secret with name `mySecret` and set its value.
* Retrieve and print the secret value.
* Delete the secret.

You can build and run the application in development mode using command:

```
quarkus dev
```

[source,java]
----
@QuarkusMain
public class KeyVaultSecretApplication implements QuarkusApplication {

    @Inject
    SecretClient secretClient;

    @Override
    public int run(String... args) throws Exception {

        Console con = System.console();

        String secretName = "mySecret";
        System.out.println("Create secret: " + secretName);

        System.out.println("Please provide the value of your secret > ");

        String secretValue = con.readLine();

        System.out.println("Creating a secret called '" + secretName + "' with value '" + secretValue + "' ... ");

        secretClient.setSecret(new KeyVaultSecret(secretName, secretValue));

        System.out.println("Retrieving your secret...");

        KeyVaultSecret retrievedSecret = secretClient.getSecret(secretName);

        System.out.println("Your secret's value is '" + retrievedSecret.getValue() + "'.");
        System.out.println("Deleting your secret ... ");

        SyncPoller<DeletedSecret, Void> deletionPoller = secretClient.beginDeleteSecret(secretName);
        deletionPoller.waitForCompletion();

        System.out.println("done.");
        return 0;
    }
}

----

After running the application, if you log into the http://portal.azure.com/[Azure portal], you can see the key vault and the secret you created.
As the secret is deleted, you will find the secret from **Objects** -> **Secrets** -> **Manage deleted secrets**.

You can also inject `com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.SecretAsyncClient` object to your application. For more usage, see https://learn.microsoft.com/java/api/com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.secretasyncclient?view=azure-java-stable[com.azure.security.keyvault.secrets.secretasyncclient].
